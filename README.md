(Re-)Emerging Technology is a technical mod exploring real-world emerging technologies. This is a fork of the [Emerging Technology](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/emerging-technology-hydroponics) by [MoonManModding](https://www.curseforge.com/members/moonmanmodding) and aims to be the definitive 1.12.2 version of the mod. This is achieved by updating dependencies, fixing bugs, and improving the current features.
